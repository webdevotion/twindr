Grindr, but for nerds

### Idea

Easy way to find people in a closed context; for example at UIKonf
and keep track of their more personal details, especially their Twitter handler.

### Tech Challenge

Set up a mesh network of iBeacons ( iPhones ).
We can't use the network / wifi mesh because it needs invitations / permissions.

When setting up iBeacons we can create a region with a certain major/minor couple.
You have to enable Bluetooth to use iBeacons.

### Feature Ideas

- authenticate with twitter oath
- filter handles from the iBeacon network your in
- find twitter handles using the public api when someone's is not using our app
